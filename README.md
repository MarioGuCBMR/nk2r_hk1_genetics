A repository for the genetic analysis performed for NK2R and HK1.

## Source of data:

To reproduce the data of these analysis the following data needs to be saved in the /raw_data folder from this repository once it is downloaded.

MAGIC HbA1c trans-ancestry genome-wide associations [Ji Che et al]: https://magicinvestigators.org/downloads/MAGIC1000G_HbA1c_TA.tsv.gz
MAGIC HbA1c trans-ancestry exome-wide associations [Sarah Willems et al]: https://magicinvestigators.org/downloads/MAGIC1000G_HbA1c_TA.tsv.gz

UKBB HbA1c exome associations: Downloaded from Genebass was downloaded by querying TACR2 in Genebass, selecting HbA1c and downloading the CSV file that you can find in /raw_data. Importantly, we did not filter the variants that were included in the burden analysis since we were interested in all SNP-level associations available. 

HUGEAMP T2D KP's HbA1c associations for HK1-NK2R-TSPAN15 loci. These can be found in /raw_data as hugeamp_associations.csv. To obtain the data go to the following link and download the CSV in the section "Variants in region (Ancestry: All)" for all ancestries: https://t2d.hugeamp.org/region.html?chr=10&end=71226674&phenotype=HBA1C&start=71113659.

## Dependencies:

All analysis were performed in Rstudio () with R (). 

The following libraries were used:
